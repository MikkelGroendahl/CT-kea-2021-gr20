Modul 4 SQL Project

Required software 

MySQL Workbench version 8.0.23 or newer.  
If it’s not already installed, it can be found on this link:  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html

Then, download the 2 SQL scripts found in this repository. 
The scripts are named "20210314-CT_Quiz_DB-group_20" and "20210314_Functions_group-20".

Open the 2 scripts by going to FILE->Open SQL Script in MySQL. 

In order to create the database and all its tables and content, 
and to populate all the tables within the database you will have to execute the script called “20210314-CT_Quiz_DB-group_20". 

The second script “20210314_Functions_group-20” is for showing some functionality in the database and it’s not meant to be executed all at once.
